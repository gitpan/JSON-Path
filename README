     # All authors of books in the store
     my $jpath   = JSON::Path->new('$.store.book[*].author');
     my @authors = $jpath->values($data);

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements JSONPath, an XPath-like language for searching
    JSON-like structures.

    JSONPath is described at <http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/>.

    This module is JSON::JOM-compatible.

  Constructor
    "JSON::Path->new($string)"
        Given a JSONPath expression $string, returns a JSON::Path object.

  Methods
    "values($object)"
        Evaluates the JSONPath expression against an object. The object
        $object can be either a nested Perl hashref/arrayref structure, or a
        JSON string capable of being decoded by JSON::from_json.

        Returns a list of structures from within $object which match against
        the JSONPath expression.

        This method will sometimes throw an error using the Error module.

    "paths($object)"
        As per "values" but instead of returning structures which match the
        expression, returns paths that point towards those structures.

    "to_string"
        Returns the original JSONPath expression as a string.

        This method is usually not needed, as the JSON::Path should
        automatically stringify itself as appropriate. i.e. the following
        works:

         my $jpath = JSON::Path->new('$.store.book[*].author');
         print "I'm looking for: " . $jpath . "\n";

PERL SPECIFICS
    JSONPath is intended as a cross-programming-language method of searching
    nested object structures. There are however, some things you need to
    think about when using JSONPath in Perl...

  JSONPath Embedded Perl Expressions
    JSONPath expressions may contain subexpressions that are evaluated using
    the native host language. e.g.

     $..book[?($_->{author} =~ /tolkien/i)]

    The stuff between "?(" and ")" is a Perl expression that must return a
    boolean, used to filter results. As arbitrary Perl may be used, this is
    clearly quite dangerous unless used in a controlled environment. Thus,
    it's disabled by default. To enable, set:

     $JSON::Path::Safe = 0;

    There are some differences between the JSONPath spec and this
    implementation.

    *   JSONPath uses a variable '$' to refer to the root node. This is not
        a legal variable name in Perl, so '$root' is used instead.

    *   JSONPath uses a variable '@' to refer to the current node. This is
        not a legal variable name in Perl, so '$_' is used instead.

  Blessed Objects
    Blessed objects are generally treated as atomic values; JSON::Path will
    not follow paths inside them. The exception to this rule are blessed
    objects where:

      Scalar::Util::blessed($object)
      && $object->can('typeof')
      && $object->typeof =~ /^(ARRAY|HASH)$/

    which are treated as an unblessed arrayref or hashref appropriately.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to <http://rt.cpan.org/>.

    Similar functionality: Data::Path, Data::DPath, Data::SPath, Hash::Path,
    Path::Resolver::Resolver::Hash, Data::Nested, Data::Hierarchy... yes,
    the idea's not especially new. What's different is that JSON::Path uses
    a vaguely standardised syntax with implementations in at least three
    other programming languages.
